// synchronous programming

//1.Blocking nature => in synchronous programming, if a task is running only after the competlion of it the next one will execute

//2.Sequential Execution => Tasks are executed in a strict sequential order.

//Asynchronous Programming

//1.Non-Blocking Nature=> in asynchronous taks are initiated and executed without waiting for the completion of the previous task

//2.Parallell- execution => Multiple tasks can be excuted at same time, and dont need to be done in a strict sequencial order

//key differences

//1.Asyncronous code is more responsive and better for applications handling multiple tasks a time

//2.Complexity => asynchronous is more complex

//3.asynchronous codes will only execute after the stack is cleared
