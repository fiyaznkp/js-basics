Event loop in js is responsible for managing the execution of code in a non-blocking and asynchronous manner.
It plays a major role in handling events ,callbacks and other aysnchronous operations in js.

Major features of event loop are =>

1.Call Stack
  .it is a data structure keep track of the execution context(functions and their variables) in the program
  .when a function is called it is pushed to the callstack
  .when a function execution is finished it is popped from the stack

2.Callback Queue
  .it is a data structure where callback functions are placed after completing asynchronous operation.

3.Event loop is a continuos process it regularly checks both callstack and callback queue .
 .it monitors the call stack for function execution and callback Queue for completed callbacks
